üè• Healthcare Regression Project: Predicting Weight using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict an individual's weight based on key factors such as height, age, and exercise level. The goal is to understand how lifestyle and demographic features contribute to body weight, which is a critical factor in healthcare analytics and wellness monitoring.

üìä Objective

- To build a **supervised learning** regression model using **Linear Regression**
- To predict **weight (kg)** based on:
  - Height (cm)
  - Age (years)
  - Exercise Level (categorical: Low, Moderate, High)
- To evaluate model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

üìÅ Dataset Overview

For this prototype, a **simulated dataset** is used. However, the structure mirrors real-world healthcare datasets and is suitable for demonstrating a typical regression pipeline.

| Feature         | Type         | Description                                 |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Height_cm`     | Numerical     | Height of the individual in centimeters      |
| `Age`           | Numerical     | Age of the individual in years               |
| `Exercise_Level`| Categorical   | Physical activity level (Low, Moderate, High) |
| `Weight_kg`     | Numerical     | Target variable ‚Äî weight in kilograms        |

> Note: Exercise level was one-hot encoded for modeling purposes.

‚öôÔ∏è Model Pipeline

1. Data Generation / Loading  
   - Created 500 samples with normally distributed height, age, and randomly assigned exercise levels.
   
2. Preprocessing 
   - One-hot encoding of `Exercise_Level`
   - Feature-target split and train-test partition (80/20 split)

3. Model Selection 
   - Simple Linear Regression (no regularization)

4. Model Training 
   - Fit the model using the training dataset

5. Evaluation
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) used to evaluate prediction accuracy on test data
   - Visual comparison using scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values

---

 üìà Results

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** *e.g., 20.75* (replace with actual result)
- The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted weight showed a strong linear trend.
- Residuals were randomly distributed, suggesting a good model fit.

 ü§ñ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- Google Colab

 üí¨ Reflections

Linear Regression provided an effective baseline for predicting weight using easily measurable inputs. The simplicity of the model allows for quick interpretation and implementation in real-world applications. However, the model could be enhanced by:

- Incorporating additional features like gender, BMI, diet, or medical history
- Using **Ridge** or **Lasso** regression for better generalization
- Collecting more real-world data or applying the model on datasets like:
  - [UCI Body Fat Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/body+fat)
  - [Kaggle: Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

 üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add polynomial or interaction terms to capture nonlinear relationships
- Use cross-validation for more robust performance evaluation
- Deploy as a healthcare analytics API or dashboard for real-time predictions
- Analyze feature importance to assist in personalized health recommendations
